# Mininet_VLANs

Simple Example

See Diagram.png for network topology

Switch uses a bridge which forwards traffic across the interfaces, the VLAN interfaces and the raw interfaces are attached because the host is not in a VLAN so needs to be able to travel over the bridge to be tagged with the VLAN
